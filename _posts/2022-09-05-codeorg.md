Creating Objects
- in java we create objects in order to call non-static functions that are not inside the main method we're in
- as long as it is inside the class we're in, we can provide the name and extend the object
- instance of a class
    - types of food within a meal

## Key Takeaways
Mainly from this unit in code.org, I learned the basics of java. I knew virtually nothing beforehand, so the simple tasks with the painter served as a great introductory for this programming language.
