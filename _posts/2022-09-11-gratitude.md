## Gratitude Note
I am most grateful for my APEL teacher Mrs. Dafoe. She taught me so much and pushed me to always look for a deeper meaning. I connected with her differently than my other teachers since she knows me so well. She's also writing a letter of recommendation for me so I'm very grateful for that. 

I am very grateful for my dad since he always makes sure I'm on top of things and that I'm staying responsible. When I need help with school work or my job, he's always ready to help.
