# FRQ Lesson: Methods and Control Structures
A method is something to be declared within a class. It only runs when it is called and you can pass parameters in a method. Methods are used to perform functions, and they are helpful since you can reuse code.

```
public class Main {
    static void myMethod() {
        //code to be executed
    }
}

```

## College Board Requirements
College board questions will include the following
- a for-loop that probably uses the methodâ€™s parameter variables,

- an if statement, probably inside the loop,

- calls to other class methods given to you,

- a numerical or string value that is calculated by the loop and returned at the end of the method.

- if the question has 2 parts, 1 part will probably require a loop and the other just an expression

College board specifically says:
