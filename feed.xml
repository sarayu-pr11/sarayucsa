They both were very intelligent speakers and gave very good advice regarding their careers and life choices. Kathyleen talked about her job path and how it wasn’t a straight line from college to her current job or profession. She mentioned how her path was a zig zag line and that resonated with me because it gave me confidence that I don’t need to have everything figured out immediately. Kathyleen also talked about how she too time off when she felt over-worked and burnt out. I thought that was an amazing choice to make for herself and it gave me something to think about. Usually, in my schoolwork and extra curricular activities, I overwhelm myself and get exhausted and this reminded me to take breaks and rest my mind sometimes. She discussed how in every job she’s worked at, the purpose of the company was to use tech for the good of the people and to help them. This was important to me because I also hope to have a positive impact with the work I’ll do in the future. Kris Porter was also another speaker who was more on the tech side while Kathyleen was on the marketing side. Kris talked about his career and a very cool research project that he did with a robot in a Costa Rican jungle. He emphasized that continuous learning is something that is important to him and I definitely agree with him on that. Both speakers also talked about how being adaptable is crucial to the workforce nowadays with the changing flow of the job market. Overall, I felt as though I learned a lot from the speakers and I am very grateful for being able to listen to them.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">FRQ 4</title><link href="https://sarayu-pr11.github.io/sarayucsa/2022/12/12/frq4.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="FRQ 4" /><published>2022-12-12T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2022-12-12T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://sarayu-pr11.github.io/sarayucsa/2022/12/12/frq4</id><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[CB FRQ 4]]></summary></entry></feed>
