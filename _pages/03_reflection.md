# Trimester Reflection
This trimester I became more familiar with coding in java and fastpages. We started with code.org and I became proficient with the basics. Then we started with deployment. WSL and ubuntu became easier for me and I got better at troubleshooting problems in the terminal. 

## Fastpages
The deployment process got better and I was able to successfully deploy my projects.

## Backend-Frontend
We used two different projects this trimester and we were able to connect features from our backend project to our frontend. We used this for our database and this is useful in the future for many things. 

## PBL
We learned many different coding techniques for our PBL features.
