    <p>Alumni Panel Reflection</p>

<p>This alumni panel was very introspective and beneficial for me. Hearing that other people have the same issues and problems as me make it more worthwhile while I do this class. When Colin was talking about how he started CSA with no prior experience or knowledge and got to where he is now, it was very motivating since I too had little experience before CSP. Additionally, Mabel was talking about how it was hard for her to get motivated to do programming since there was always someone better who could do it faster and more efficiently. She talked about how once she got over that mental block, she was able to find a passion with CS and programming. This is very relatable to me because like Allison said, the temptation to just put the least amount of effort into my work is very real, but I know that to flourish and be successful in this class and in the future, I need to put in the work myself and hold myself accountable for my learning.</p>

<p>The alumni’s answers also made me appreciate the class structure we have right now. They talked a lot about how unorganized college CS can be and how hard it can get without structure. Their discussions with real life scenarios and applications of CS also gave me some hope since Mabel talked about how she went into aerospace engineering, something I want to do as well, with only CSA under her tool belt. She talked about how she was able to learn more in college, but how she wished she had done more in high school. With this information, I have more hope in my future career in college and high school since I know the things that I face are not unique to me, but are widespread across the board to hundreds of other people.</p>
