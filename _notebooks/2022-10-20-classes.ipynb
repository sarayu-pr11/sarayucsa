    "## Vocab\n",
    "- **Overloading a method, same name different parameters\n",
    "    - Overloading a method in java is a feature that allows a class to have more than one method with the same name, but with different parameters\n",
    "    - Instead of defining two methods that do the same thing, it is better to overload one\n",
    "- **Overriding a method, same signature of a method\n",
    "    - Method overriding occurs when a subclass has the same method as the parent class\n",
    "    - When a subclass provides a particular implementation of a method declared by one of its parent classes\n",
    "- **Abstract Class, Abstract Method\n",
    "    - A abstract class cannot be instantiated but they can be subclassed\n",
    "    - An abstract method is a method that has just the method definition but does not contain implementation\n",

    "- object:\n",
    "    - state attributes, behavior, \n",

    "    - defines an abstract data tye\n",
    "    - string variables\n",
    "    - instance variables: attributes, behaviors\n",
    "    - data for objects\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methods and Constructors\n",
    "- methods are behaviors or actions that apply to the objects\n",
    "- constructors create the object\n",
    "- main method tests class and instance variables\n",
    "\n",
    "## Constructors\n",
    "- special method for instantiation\n",
    "    - sets initial values\n",

    "### This\n",
    "- refers to the constructor that is being called in\n",
    "- eliminated confusion between attribute and parameters\n",
    "### Access Modifiers\n",
    "- restricts scope of classes variables and function\n",
