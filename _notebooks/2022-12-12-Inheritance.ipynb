    "## Vocab\n",
    "- inheritance, extends\n",
    "    - a way for attributes and methods to be inherited between clases\n",
    "    - extends is what allows you to bring those attributes\n",
    "- subclass constuctor, super Keyword 2\n",
    "    - A subclass inherits all the members from the superclass while the constructor of the superclass can be invoked from the subclass\n",
    "    - Super keyword refers to superclass objects; it is used to call superclass methods and to access the superclass costructor\n",
    "- Overloading a method, same name different parameters\n",
    "    - Overloading a method in java is a feature that allows a class to have more than one method with the same name, but with different parameters\n",
    "    - Instead of defining two methods that do the same thing, it is better to overload one\n",
    "- Polymorphism: any of overloading, overriding, late binding\n",
    "    - Polymorphism is the ability of a class to provide different implementations of a method depending on the type of object that is passed to the method\n",
    "    - Allows us to perform the same action in many different ways\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inheritance\n",
    "- The ability of a class to derive properties and characteristics from another class\n",
    "## Writing constructors for subclasses\n",
    "- can reuse the code and add attributes if needed in every subclass.\n",
    "- subclass can also become a super class by extending it again in another subclass\n",
    "- Same for a constructor in which the keyword 'super' is used to call the super class constructor and can add additional attributes for personalization\n",
    "## Overriding methods\n",
    "- Override\n",
    "    - different implementations to the method of superclass\n",
    "## Polymorphism\n",
    "- used when we have multiple classes that are related by inheritance.\n",
    "## Object superclass\n",
    "- located at the top of every class hierarchy\n",
    "- all the other classes in hierarchy can use the attributes and methods of the object superclass through inheritance.\n",
